# Personal Project: Image Classification

This repository contains the files used in my personal project (IB), which was about image classification. Specifically, writing a classifier machine learning model to predict the "type" of object in an image.

You can replicate my image classifier by downloading the contents of this repository and performing the necessary installations on your device. To get the website working locally, you should install Anaconda and, from the Anaconda terminal, use the `exts-ml.yml` file (from the EPFL Extension School) to install the relevant machine learning libraries as well as Flask. Then, run `py api.py` and visit the URL that appears in the terminal.
