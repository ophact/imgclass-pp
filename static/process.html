                        <p class="main__element--desc">I come up with my initial idea: to build a Large Language Model (LLM) similar to ChatGPT, capable of writing essays from given prompts. It's a very ambitious idea and I eagerly await to work on it.</p>

                        <p class="main__element--desc">After some more thinking, I find that this idea is very unrealistic. Learning about natural language processing, which takes a lot of time to implement correctly, AND learning about generation which is a whole other field of machine learning, AND finding the required datasets, AND doing it all well while documenting the entire process and coping with the high workload I have from other courses is definitely unachievable. So I switch my idea to image classification, which is much more feasible. It's also a rather standard machine learning problem, but I add a twist, whereby I predict the <em>type</em> of object instead of the precise object.</p>

By now I have also started researching about the best models for image classification purposes. I quickly find about the convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of artificial neural network that incorporates convolutions before the fully connected part as well. More on that later.</p>

Those categories will form the basis of determining the "type of object" present in an image, e.g. vehicles, land animals, flowers, etc.</p>

In the meeting, themes such as a model's overfitting and exploratory data analysis were discussed.</p>

                        <p class="main__element--desc">I had a second primary source meeting because of more technical issues related to my model's overfitting. A decision was made to increase the size of the dataset to 19500 images. I was also introduced to <strong>Google Colab</strong>, a platform which allows one to run code virtually on a GPU. It greatly increased my productivity in the final parts of my project.</p>

Now my model can predict 55% of validation samples correctly. Absolutely brilliant.</p>
